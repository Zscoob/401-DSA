## Challenge 1, ReverseArray
  - reverse an array without using the Reverse method.

### Approach and efficiency
  - created an array that would produce a new array which would take the length and reverse it as a string

### Solution
URL (/assets/img/blackboard.png); 

## Challenge 2, shiftArray
  - add a value into the middle of an arrow without a built in method

### Approach and efficiency
  - looped a int into the middle of the array by dividing the length in half.

### Solution
URL (/assets/img/whiteboard.png); 

## Challenge 3, binary search
  - binary search an array. tests test green,  return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the      element does not exist.
### Approach and efficiency
  - used a while loop, if, if else, else statments to gage mid and max index in an array
  - divided by 2 to get length
  - inputArr.Length -1 for max
  - min = 0
  - return -1 if null
